Severity scores are useful for consistency, but they are not a complete prioritization method.

A score describes technical characteristics. It does not fully describe business consequence.

## What Severity Scores Help With

Severity frameworks help teams:

- Use a shared language
- Compare findings in a structured way
- Reduce reporting ambiguity

This is valuable for classification.

---

## Where Teams Can Go Wrong

Problems start when scores are treated as automatic task order.

A high-scored issue may be constrained by strong safeguards. A medium-scored issue may be urgent if it affects core customer workflows.

Without context, priority decisions can be distorted.

---

## What Else Should Inform Priority

Before deciding fix order, also assess:

- External reachability
- Data sensitivity
- Impact on critical user actions
- Existing controls and containment
- Realistic misuse potential

This gives a clearer picture of real risk.

---

## Practical Outcome

Use severity to classify findings.

Use context to prioritize remediation.

Teams that separate these two steps usually make faster and more stable security decisions.
