OWASP Top 10 is a useful reference for common web application risk areas.

It helps teams talk about risk categories with shared language.

But it is not a full inspection by itself.

---

## What OWASP Top 10 Is Good For

It helps with:

- Coverage planning across common risk categories
- Consistent finding classification
- Clear communication between technical teams

As a reference, it improves structure.

---

## What It Does Not Do

OWASP Top 10 does not:

- Define your engagement scope
- Replace written authorization
- Understand your business workflows
- Determine your final remediation priority

Those decisions still require context and inspection judgment.

---

## How It Fits in Structured Inspection

In a structured inspection, OWASP Top 10 is used as one input.

The full process still includes:

- Written scope and authorization
- Controlled testing within boundaries
- Evidence-backed validation
- Priority decisions based on business impact

This keeps reporting practical and decision-focused.

---

## Practical Outcome

Use OWASP Top 10 for structure.

Use structured inspection for context, prioritization, and action.

Together, they produce clearer risk decisions than category mapping alone.
