Automated scanners are useful and should be part of modern security work.

But automated scanning alone is not the same as a full inspection.

Scanners find patterns. Inspection interprets risk in context.

---

## What Automated Scans Do Well

Scanners are strong at repeatable checks across many endpoints.

They can quickly identify:

- Common misconfigurations
- Known vulnerability signatures
- Outdated dependencies
- Basic exposure hygiene issues

This gives teams fast signal and broad coverage.

---

## What Automated Scans Usually Miss

Scanners do not understand business intent.

They often cannot answer:

- Is this endpoint intentionally public?
- Does this access rule match the real role model?
- Does this issue create meaningful business harm?

They also struggle with multi-step workflows and business logic weaknesses.

---

## Why Context Still Matters

Two findings with similar technical labels can have very different practical risk.

A scan can report a weakness, but it cannot reliably decide priority for your environment.

That decision needs human review, scope awareness, and business context.

---

## How Automation Fits in a Structured Inspection

A practical inspection flow usually looks like this:

- Define written scope and authorization
- Run automated checks within that scope
- Review findings in business context
- Perform focused manual validation where needed
- Prioritize by real operational impact

Automation supports this process. It does not replace it.

---

## Practical Outcome

Use scanners for coverage and speed.

Use inspection for interpretation, prioritization, and clear decision support.

When both are used together, teams get better visibility and better remediation decisions.
