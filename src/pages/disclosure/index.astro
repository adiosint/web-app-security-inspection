    <h1 id="disclosure-title">Security Disclosure Policy</h1>
    <p>
      This practice conducts web application security inspections strictly under defined scope and written authorization.
    </p>
    <p>
      No active testing, automated scanning, exploitation, or validation of security weaknesses is performed without explicit permission from the system owner.
    </p>

    <h2>Scope &amp; Boundaries</h2>
    <p>This policy applies only to work performed under formal engagement.</p>
    <p>
      This practice does not authorize or request unsolicited testing, scanning, or probing of any third-party systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you believe a vulnerability exists in an organization’s system, you should contact the system owner directly or follow their published disclosure process.
    </p>

    <h2>Professional Conduct</h2>
    <p>
      All security engagements are governed by written scope, authorization, and mutually agreed boundaries.
    </p>
    <p>This reflects a commitment to lawful, ethical, and structured security practice.</p>

    <h2>No Bug Bounty Program</h2>
    <p>
      This practice does not operate a public bug bounty program and does not provide monetary rewards for unsolicited vulnerability reports.
    </p>

    <h2>Reporting a Security Concern</h2>
    <p>
      If you wish to report a security concern related to work performed under this inspection practice, please contact:
    </p>
    <p><a href="mailto:salam@sayyidishaarani.com">salam@sayyidishaarani.com</a></p>
    <p>
      Please include sufficient technical detail to allow independent reproduction and validation of the issue. Reports should describe:
    </p>

      <li>The observed behavior</li>
      <li>Steps to reproduce (if known)</li>
